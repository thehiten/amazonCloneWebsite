Amazon Clone
The Amazon Clone project is a front-end web development exercise aimed at replicating the design and layout of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. Below, I'll provide a detailed explanation of the project, its features, and the technologies used.

Detailed Explanation
Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to practice and showcase front-end web development skills. By cloning the Amazon homepage, developers can gain hands-on experience in building complex layouts, styling elements, and creating responsive designs.

Features
Replicated Design: The project closely mimics the layout, design elements, and overall look of the Amazon homepage. This includes features like the navigation bar, search bar, product sections, and footer.

HTML & CSS: The project uses HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling. This separation of concerns follows best practices in web development and makes the codebase easy to understand and maintain.

Responsive Design: The clone is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it looks and functions well on various devices and screen sizes. This includes implementing media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different viewport sizes.

Technologies Used
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is used to structure the content of the webpage. It defines the layout and hierarchy of elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the HTML elements, defining their appearance, layout, and presentation. This includes properties for colors, fonts, margins, padding, and more.

Additional Details
Images and Assets: The project may include images and other assets necessary to replicate the visual elements of the Amazon homepage. These assets are typically stored in an "assets" folder within the project directory.

Fonts and Icons: The clone may utilize custom fonts and icons to match the design of the Amazon homepage. These resources are usually imported or linked in the HTML or CSS files.

Modularization: To maintain clean and organized code, the project may be divided into separate HTML and CSS files for different sections or components of the webpage. This modular approach makes it easier to manage and update the codebase.
